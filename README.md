# `elm-lazy-scroll`: Seamless lazy-rendered scrolling in Elm.

Do you need to render *large* lists of data in your Elm app?  Have you
noticed Elm slowing down significantly when it tries to render lists
containing thousands of elements?  Are you considering using [infinite
scrolling][elm-infinite-scroll]?

It is similar in function to the React component
[`react-virtualized`][react-virtualized].

# Features

- Fast: capable of rendering *large* lists of data smoothly
  (tested to successfully handle 50,000 elements).
- Seamless: virtually indistinguishable from plain, `overflow: scroll`
  elements.  No janky scrollbars, no "load more" buttons, no "loading"
  spinners, etc.
- Mobile-friendly: behaves the same as any scrollable element.
